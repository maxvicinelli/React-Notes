Lab 3: Reactnotes 

Deployed URL: http://maxvicinelli-cs52-reactnotes.surge.sh/

I made a webapp where you can create, edit, and delete "notes". The notes are stored via firebase, so you can edit them on multiple devices at once. 

## What Worked Well

Overall things worked pretty well in this lab. I actually really liked using react, as it I found it far more straightforward than JS and much less frustrating than just styling and placing Divs like we did a lot in the first few labs. This was definitely my favorite so far. I think my drag, delete, and edit all work very smoothly, and I only had a few random, fixable bugs along the way. 

## What Didn't

I definitely struggled with understanding the syntax and mechanisms of react at first. When I started the lab, I just didn't really know where to begin. But after some reading online, I was able to get going.
